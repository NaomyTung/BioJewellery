                            Canadian company whose mission is to transform nature into 
                            jewelry. Is in the diversity of the Brazilian flora where we find inspiration and raw material to 
                            create the pieces. 
                            Our earrings, pendants, rings, bracelets and necklaces are handmade using natural 
                            leaves and seeds, which, after being prepared with special technique, are plated in 18k gold, 
                            transforming into beautiful biojewels.
